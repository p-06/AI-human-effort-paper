AI and the Irreplaceability of Human Effort
An Inquiry into Labor Economies and Ethics

Author: Partha Roy

About This Paper

This repository contains the working paper “AI and the Irreplaceability of Human Effort: An Inquiry into Labor Economies and Ethics”.
The essay explores the paradox of artificial intelligence in relation to human labor, arguing that while AI can boost productivity and reshape markets, the complete substitution of human effort is neither feasible nor desirable on ethical grounds.

It combines three strands of analysis:
Labor economies: The risks of automation displacing vulnerable forms of work, particularly in informal and gig sectors.
Market dynamics: Whether AI creates genuinely new demand or merely redistributes value.
Ethics of work: Human labor as a source of dignity, autonomy, and meaning beyond economic productivity.

Key Contributions
Provides a synthesis of global institutional perspectives (IMF, ILO, OECD) on the future of work.
Frames AI not only as an economic tool but as an ethical and civilizational challenge.
Offers a balanced argument for supplementing, not substituting, human labor.

Structure of the Paper
Abstract – Overview of the paradox.
Introduction – Global perspectives on AI and work.
